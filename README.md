# PHP_for_WORDPRESS

as an aspiring junior developer I thought entering a position in which the demands are 75% React and 25% back end would delve me further into JS.

truth of the matter, most client assets are built in good old wordpress with a lot of ACF fields.

the purpose of this self course is to develop the knowledge base, snippets and to extend my diminishing knowledge of native wordpress into a monster.

my goals is also to hack into PHP and Laravel, twigs etc.

I'm at a point in which PHP has met me on so many levels - this cannot be ignored-
bring it on - OOP, MVC, the full works - I want to acquire this knowledge and share the learning process.

if you read this far then congrats and hats off to you- this makes us colleagues in a manner- don't hesitate to contact me at anguru AT gmail.com for any further question.
